# DeepSup_manifolds
This repository illustrates the data processing and analysis used to study cell-type-specific population representations in the hippocampus, as published in Esparza et al. Neuron 2025 (...). The data can be found in [FigShare](https://figshare.com/account/home#/projects/233675).

We offer a simple jupyter notebook ([DeepSup_manifold_example.ipynb](https://github.com/PridaLab/DeepSup_manifolds/blob/main/DeepSup_manifold_example.ipynb)) that goes step by step into some of the analysis. Given the dataset's size (over 20TB) and how expensive some of the analysis are (such as the betti numbers computations), the jupyter notebook only exemplifies some of the analysis.
